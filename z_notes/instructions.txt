Cowl bytecode will consist of instructions, with each instruction name taking up 8 bits, and the length of an instruction will depend on the instruction itself.

[load variable: 8 bits][pointer index: 32 bits]
[save variable: 8 bits][pointer index: 32 bits][variable type: ][variable value: ]
[operation: 8 bits][operation type: 8 bits][first operand index: 32 bits][second operand index: 32 bits]
