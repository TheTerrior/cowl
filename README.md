## General Information
This language is being written in my free time, just for fun and to gain programming experience.

A programming language that is easy to learn and use, with a focus on new users. The goal is a general-purpose, statically-typed language with functional and object-oriented features. Syntax is similar to C with some extra customizations. Associated filetypes are cl, cowl (both for code), and ccl (for bytecode).

This language will be interpreted for the foreseeable future, with a possible compiler coming in the future if I'm willing to take on the daunting task. The interpreter will be written in Rust, which will ensure high performance and memory-safety. Code goes through a semi-compilation stage which converts the raw code into bytecode, much like Java. This bytecode can then be run by the interpreter.
